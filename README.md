The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in agriculture has revolutionized conventional farming
practices, providing more efficient and sustainable solutions. In IoT-based greenhouse monitoring and
controlling system designed to optimize plant growth conditions. The system incorporates
various sensors including DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, Light sensor(LDR) for check the light intensity.
The hardware setup comprises an ESP8266 microcontroller,LED,buzzer. Data collected from the sensors are transmitted to a ThingSpeak channel for remote
monitoring and analysis. The system aims to enhance crop yield and minimize environmental impact by maintaining optimal
environmental conditions within the greenhouse.
